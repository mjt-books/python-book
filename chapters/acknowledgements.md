# Acknowledgments

My thanks go first to the quiet constellation of thinkers, builders, and dreamers whose work lights the way forward. This book stands on the shoulders of countless open-source contributors, researchers, and curious minds who dared to imagine what could be.

To the friends and fellow travelers who offered encouragement, challenge, or simply presence—your support turned doubt into progress.

And to every reader who meets the future with curiosity rather than fear:
you are the reason books like this are written.
