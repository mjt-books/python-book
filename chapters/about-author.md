# About the Author

Matt Taylor is a software developer, systems thinker, and lifelong experimenter with a focus on building practical AI systems. Over the past two decades, he has worked across a wide spectrum of technology—from high-performance backend systems to distributed machine-learning pipelines—and brings a pragmatic, results-first approach to the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence.

He is particularly interested in the real-world challenges that arise once AI workloads move beyond notebooks: scaling models, managing data pipelines, deploying production systems, and understanding how these technologies fit into the broader landscape of modern computing. This book grew out of his desire to help developers bridge the gap between experimentation and reliable, grounded AI engineering.

When he isn’t writing or building new tools, Matt explores game engines, experiments with novel computing architectures, and spends time reflecting on the intersection of technology, creativity, and human potential.
